            <h3>Your Recipe Collection</h3>
            <p>We have the concept of multiple recipe boxes for each user.  So you could have your "camping" recipes in one box and "at home" recipes in another.  Or maybe it's that you want to have a set of recipes for parties and a set for your family.  Or maybe one is for your nanny and then one is for yourself.  I guess what I'm trying to say is do whatever you want with the idea of haivng multiple boxes.  And, when it's all said and done, you clearly can <strong>just have one box</strong>!</p>
